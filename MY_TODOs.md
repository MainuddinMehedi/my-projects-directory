**contribution heatmap widget**
You can make a footer which shows the github contribution heatmap
Or any other analytical showoff able widget.

**thumbnail and images**
Delete thumbnail as a separate image. Make the first image of the gallery the thumbnail
When you take the input for image a let user upload multiple file in a input box and reorder them. So it becomes easier.

  And another will show how many projects that are here but private.
  - The purpose of this is to give people a idea how many projects. i've worked on so far. As i'm thinking of using this publicly this will be necessary.
