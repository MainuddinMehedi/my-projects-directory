# NOTE'S

For now stop this later comeback and fix the models analyze what you need and you want to have.
and then write the types accordingly.
don't write it all right away. write them when you need them.

Right now the latest projects fetch result is showing empty for some reason. debug this.

Or any other analytical showoff able widget.

# FUTURE PLANS

- I will have count which shows how many projects are in this directory.
  And another will show how many projects that are here but private.
  - The purpose of this is to give people a idea how many projects. i've worked on so far. As i'm thinking of using this publicly this will be necessary.
