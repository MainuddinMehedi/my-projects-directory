**contribution heatmap widget**
You can make a footer which shows the github contribution heatmap
Or any other analytical showoff able widget.

---

**thumbnail and images**
Delete thumbnail as a separate image. Make the first image of the gallery the thumbnail
When you take the input for image a let user upload multiple file in a input box and reorder them. So it becomes easier.
The first image will be used as the thumbnail will be shown as a message there.

**Two option of adding new project - _started_ or _complete_**
you can keep two choices. Either a complete project or a project that i just started. In this case i won't have many detailed info about it. So i have to make some features optional. A checkbox to opt into that mode.

# FUTURE PLANS

- I will have count which shows how many projects are in this directory.
  And another will show how many projects that are here but private.
  - The purpose of this is to give people a idea how many projects. i've worked on so far. As i'm thinking of using this publicly this will be necessary.
